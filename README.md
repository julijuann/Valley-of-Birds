# Valley-of-Birds: A Grid-Based C++ Game Simulation
This C++ project simulates a player navigating through a valley filled with birds. The player can move around the grid and interact with birds by flinging rocks to knock them out. The birds, meanwhile, move randomly across the valley. The goal is to clear the valley by knocking out all the birds without dying. The simulation handles object-oriented gameplay elements like movement, interaction between player and birds, and rendering the valley in a console interface.

## Features:
Dynamic bird movement
Player interaction and rock-flinging mechanics
Real-time valley updates with grid-based display
Object-oriented design with class-based structure

## Details
Developed in Xcode for a UCLA course from March to May 2024, this project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and dynamic game mechanics in a console-based simulation.
